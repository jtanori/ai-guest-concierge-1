## PR Review

Before creating a PR, and when reviewing any PR, apply this checklist.
Report findings by severity: **Blocker** (do not merge), **High**
(merge only with explicit justification), **Medium** (flag for follow-up).

### Blockers
- [ ] One path. Traced end to end, including failure steps. (SEC-01)
- [ ] Boundaries. Auth, tenancy, input validation, untrusted input unchanged or changed on purpose. (SEC-02)
- [ ] CI. Every diff under .github/ read in full. No skipped tests, no lowered thresholds, no moved triggers. (SEC-03)
- [ ] Evidence. A test, CI run, or screenshot proves this ran. (SEC-04)
- [ ] APIs and imports. Every symbol exists in the version this repo runs. (SEC-05)

### High
- [ ] Shape. One sentence describes the change; matches the title.
- [ ] Blast radius. Nothing outside stated scope moved.
- [ ] Deletions. No live callers; removals are intentional.
- [ ] Config and permissions. New env vars, scopes, timeouts named in the description and are ones we want.

### Medium
- [ ] Duplication. New helper/client/type doesn't already exist under another name. (SEC-06)
- [ ] Test quality. Tests would fail if the code were broken. (SEC-07)
- [ ] Performance. No N+1 queries, unbounded loops, missing pagination on production paths.

## Review output

Post findings as a single PR review via POST /pulls/{n}/reviews with
event=COMMENT. Never approve, request changes, push, or merge.

### Format
- One inline comment per finding, anchored to the smallest relevant
  line range on the PR head commit.
- Each comment: severity tag, one-sentence problem statement, then
  the fix.
- When the fix is a drop-in replacement for the anchored lines, end
  the comment body with a suggestion block:

    ```suggestion
    <replacement code, exact indentation>
    ```

  The suggestion block must be the **last** content in the body —
  GitHub strips anything after the closing fence.
- When the fix spans multiple lines, use start_line + line in the
  API payload (side: "RIGHT").
- When the fix is architectural or cross-file, post the recommendation
  as prose or a plain code block instead of a suggestion block.
- The review body (top-level) holds a 2–4 sentence summary and any
  findings that can't be anchored to a diff line. Reference inline
  threads by file:line rather than repeating them.

### Fallback: comment-only review
If you cannot complete a full review (missing context, can't run tests,
diff too large, tool unavailable), still post a COMMENT-event review:
- State explicitly what you could and couldn't verify.
- List the checklist items you skipped and why.
- Post whatever findings you did identify, with the same format above.
- Mark the review body with `⚠️ Partial review` on the first line.

Never fall back to a PR issue comment (POST /issues/{n}/comments).
That endpoint is not read by review gates.

Why the fallback matters
The most common failure mode I see in the wild: an agent that "can't do a full review" either posts nothing, or posts a top-level PR comment that looks like feedback but is invisible to any CI gate or review-status check. By pinning the fallback to the same COMMENT-event endpoint, the output is always in the same place a human or a downstream check expects to find it.

One practical note on suggestion blocks
GitHub only renders the "Commit suggestion" button when:
- The comment is an inline review comment (not the review body)
- The suggestion block is the last element in the body
- The existing code (the lines being replaced) matches the diff exactly — whitespace included

If your agent generates a suggestion that doesn't match the current line content, GitHub silently drops the button and shows it as plain code. That's a non-issue (it degrades gracefully), but worth knowing so you don't think the feature is broken.
